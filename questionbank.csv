1,Adjust the sliders so that the probability of having the disease given a positive test result is exactly 50%,"Set: Prevalence = 1, Specificity = 0.999, Sensitivity = 0.999",
2,Adjust the sliders so that the probability of having the disease given a positive test result is greater than 50%,"Set: Prevalence = 3, Specificity = 0.997, Sensitivity = 0.999",
3,Adjust the sliders so that the probability of having the disease given a positive test result is less than 50%,"Set: Prevalence = 1, Specificity = 0.999, Sensitivity = 0.995",
4,Adjust only the prevalence slider. How does this affect the probability of having the disease given a positive test result?,"As prevalence is increased, the probability also increases.",
5,Adjust only the sensitivity slider. How does this affect the probability of having the disease given a positive test result?,"As sensitivity is increased, the  probability also increases.",
6,Adjust only the specificity slider. How does this affect the probability of having the disease given a positive test result?,"As specificity is increased, the probability decreases.",
7,"If the disease is relatively rare, does sensitivity or specificity have a bigger effect on the probability of having the disease given a positive test result?",Specificity has a much bigger effect on the probability than sensitivity. Set prevalence to 1 and move the sliders to see this.,
8,Adjust the sliders so that the probability of having the disease given a positive test result is greater than 60%,"Set: Prevalence = 2, Specificity = 0.999, Sensitivity = 0.999",60
9,Adjust the sliders so that the probability of having the disease given a positive test result is greater than 70%,"Set: Prevalence = 3, Specificity = 0.999, Sensitivity = 0.999",70
10,Adjust the sliders so that the probability of having the disease given a positive test result is greater than 80%,"Set: Prevalence = 6, Specificity = 0.999, Sensitivity = 0.999",80
11,Adjust the sliders so that the probability of having the disease given a positive test result is greater than 90%,"Set: Prevalence = 12, Specificity = 0.999, Sensitivity = 0.999",90
12,Adjust the sliders so that the probability of having the disease given a positive test result is greater than 95%,"Set: Prevalence = 30, Specificity = 0.999, Sensitivity = 0.999",95
13,Adjust the sliders so that the probability of having the disease given a positive test result is greater than 99%,"Set: Prevalence = 100, Specificity = 0.999, Sensitivity = 0.999",99
14,Adjust the sliders so that the probability of having the disease given a positive test result is less than 40%,"Set: Prevalence = 30, Specificity = 0.950, Sensitivity = 0.999",40
15,Adjust the sliders so that the probability of having the disease given a positive test result is less than 30%,"Set: Prevalence = 30, Specificity = 0.925, Sensitivity = 0.999",30
16,Adjust the sliders so that the probability of having the disease given a positive test result is less than 20%,"Set: Prevalence = 30, Specificity = 0.875, Sensitivity = 0.999",20
17,Adjust the sliders so that the probability of having the disease given a positive test result is less than 10%,"Set: Prevalence = 30, Specificity = 0.700, Sensitivity = 0.999",10
18,Adjust the sliders so that the probability of having the disease given a positive test result is less than 5%,"Set: Prevalence = 25, Specificity = 0.500, Sensitivity = 0.999",5
